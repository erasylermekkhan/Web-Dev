    <h2>“No Man Is An Island” by John Donne
</h2>
    <p>
        No man is an island, <br>

Entire of itself,<br>

Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>

A part of the main.<br>

If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>

Europe is the less.<br>

As well as if a promontory were.<br>

As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>

Or of thine own were:<br>

Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>

Because I am involved in mankind,<br>

And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>

It tolls for thee.
